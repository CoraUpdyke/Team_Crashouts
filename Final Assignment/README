Team Members: McAlyster Legaspi, Cora Updyke
Modifications: speed up when holding shift, cat companion that shoots cupcakes able to destroy ghosts with spacebar, a camera POV switch to better view John Lemon and cat companion

Cora's Biggest Challenge: In the course it would be making the FPS game have a cohesive theme. In this project I would say trying to understand all of the coding following the tutorial.
Will Cora Continue This: It's possible I come back to this later on, I think it would be nice to have a title screen.

McAlyster's Challenge: My main struggle throughout the course was coding. I did have trouble deciding what mod I would make and how I would execute them but I eventually figured it out in time.
Will McAlyster continue this: I'm not sure that I would continue this project specifically as I would rather try working on projects with assets that I created myself. I will say that this project was good practice.
